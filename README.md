# TIC-TAC-TOE
This is a C++ program for two-player Tic Tac Toe. It has a Player class with mark, name, and score properties, and a Board class with methods to display the board, place the mark, and check for a winner. The program alternates turns until a player wins or there is a draw. The winner's score increases, and the game continues until players quit.
